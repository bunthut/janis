joplin.views

This namespace provides access to view-related services.
Creating a view

All view services provide a create() method which you would use to create the view object, whether it's a dialog, a toolbar button or a menu item. In some cases, the create() method will return a ViewHandle, which you would use to act on the view, for example to set certain properties or call some methods.
The webviewApi object

Within a view, you can use the global object webviewApi for various utility functions, such as sending messages or displaying context menu. Refer to WebviewApi for the full documentation.
